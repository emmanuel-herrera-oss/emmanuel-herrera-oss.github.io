# Color Quantization Revisited

In a previous [article](../color-quantization), I implemented a color quantizer using HTML's Canvas element to process images from many 
formats into pixel data that I could use. An effect of this decision is that the image was automatically rescaled to no larger than 480 
pixels wide. This was nice for the demo since it ensuered that the processing time didn't become too long for large photos, but it made
me wonder how long it would really take to process a high resolution image. 

## Test Results
The first thing I did was to write a standalone [Bun application](https://github.com/emmanuel-herrera-oss/color-quantization/tree/main/ts) 
to process the image without rescaling. It's based on the demo code from the previous article, but doesn't make use of web workers since 
there's no UI thread to worry about. To test its performance, I color-quantized a 3840x2564 image using k = 8, 16, 32, and 64. 
Here are the results:

|K  |Time (ms)|Iterations|ms per iteration|
|---|---------|----------|----------------|
|8  |6645     |14        |475             |
|16 |15105    |23        |657             |
|32 |32922    |27        |1219            |
|64 |129412   |58        |2231            |

Next, I reimplemented the same algorithm in [C++](https://github.com/emmanuel-herrera-oss/color-quantization/tree/main/cpp). Much faster!
The time per iteration was always less than 25% for the C++ program vs the Bun program. Interestingly, the C++ program usually ran for 
more iterations before converging, so the total time savings wasn't as big as the per-iteration time savings. I'm not sure why this is the case.
At first I thought maybe it was related to me using 32 bit floats in the C++ program vs Bun us ing 64 bit floats, but this behavior persisted 
even after changing all the floats to doubles.

|K  |Time (ms)|Iterations|ms per iteration|
|---|---------|----------|----------------|
|8  |1442     |14        |103             |
|16 |5718     |35        |163             |
|32 |10657    |37        |288             |
|64 |50040    |98        |510             |

The last thing I wanted to try was to make this [multithreaded](https://github.com/emmanuel-herrera-oss/color-quantization/tree/main/cpp-mt) 
These are my results running 8 threads on an 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 8700F. Definitely an improvement. For k=64 this version took only 10% of the time it
took the Bun version. nice. 

|K  |Time (ms)|Iterations|ms per iteration|
|---|---------|----------|----------------|
|8  |1118     |23        |49              |
|16 |2799     |42        |67              |
|32 |3797     |38        |100             |
|64 |12170    |76        |160             |

## Multithreading
The core loop of this program iterates through every pixel in the image and assigns it to a cluster. My first attempt at making this program
multithreaded was to take this loop and break it up into threads. This resulted in memory errors. What was happening is that I was using a
std::vector to store the pixels for each cluster. Sometimes, multiple threads would append to the same vector at the same time and trigger a
vector resize. To fix this, I added a mutex that was locked before each write to a vector, but this actually made the program super slow! Even
slower than with a single thread.

My next attempt was allocate an std::vector array in each thread and then have the threads store their results in this temporary vector instead
of the one used in the main thread. Once the thread is done working, it obtains the lock and copies all the elements from its temporary vector
to the main vector. This improved performane drastically, but it used more memory and I felt that there might be a better way. 

In the end, I got rid of the vectors entirely and came up with a different way of storing the relationship between a pixel and a cluster. Specifically:

1. Allocate an array of k Centroids. 
2. Allocate an array of W x H ints. Element i of this array holds the index (0...k-1) of the centroid to which pixel i belongs. 

By making these changes, I didn't have to use any locking or temporary storage, and I was able to get the best performance. Here's the final code that runs on each thread: 
<div class="code-block">
```cpp
static void chunk(unsigned int thread_id, const QuantizeOptions& options, Centroid* centroids, int* clusters) {
    while (true) {
        if (finished) {
            return;
        }
        if (!signals[thread_id]) {
            continue;
        }
        int points_per_thread = options.image_len / options.thread_count + 1;
        for (unsigned int point_idx = thread_id * points_per_thread; point_idx < (thread_id + 1) * points_per_thread; point_idx++)
        {
            if (point_idx >= options.image_len) {
                break;
            }
            float min_distance = -1;
            int min_idx = -1;
            auto point = options.image + 4 * point_idx;
            for (unsigned int centroid_idx = 0; centroid_idx < options.cluster_count; centroid_idx++)
            {
                auto distance = distance_from_centroid(centroids[centroid_idx], point);
                if (min_idx < 0 || distance < min_distance)
                {
                    min_distance = distance;
                    min_idx = centroid_idx;
                }
            }
            clusters[point_idx] = min_idx;
        }
        signals[thread_id] = false;
    }
}
```

## Final Thoughts
Adding multithreading to an application is not something to take lightly. It might require you to completely change how you think about 
your problem in order to come to an efficient solution. However, when you're done, you'll feel satisfied to see those expensive cores you
paid for put to good use. 

After this exercise, I've gained more appreciation for C#'s [Task Parallel Library (TPL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl). 
I've had the opportunity to use Parallel.For and IEnumerable.AsParallel a few times at work to great effect. Now I realize that 
there's a lot going on under the hood when I use TPL, and I'm glad that .NET is taking care of it for me ðŸ˜Œ
