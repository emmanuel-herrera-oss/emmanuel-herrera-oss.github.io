# Mandelbrot Fractal using WebGL
Drawing a Mandelbrot Fractal can be a lot simpler than the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Basic_properties)
would have you believe. It's essentially just a complex number calculation applied to every pixel on 
the screen. Here's the specific procedure I implemented:

For every pixel (x', y'):
1. Initialize:
    - x = (2.47 / screen_width) * x' - 2
    - y = (2.24 / screen_height) * y' - 1.12
    - z = 0 + 0**i**
    - c = x + **i**y
    - iterations = 0
    - MaxIterations = 1000
2. Set z equal to z<sup>2</sup> + c. 
3. Repeat step 2 until  |z| > 4 or iterations > MaxIterations, 
4. Set the color of pixel (x, y) based on the number of iterations
    - If iterations >= MaxIterations, set the pixel to black
    - Else set the pixel to rgb(sqrt(10 * iterations), sqrt(10 * iterations), sqrt(10 * iterations))

Regarding #1, the constants 2.47, 2.24, 2, and 1.12 come from the [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Computer_drawings)
in the Wikipedia article. They provide a good view of the standard fractal image. From these starting values,
it's possible to zoom and move the view around to see different features of the fractal. 

Regarding #4, there are many ways to assign a color to a pixel based on the iteration count. I found that
lower iteration counts were more common than high ones, and the square root function did a decent job of 
assigning more dynamic range to those counts than wasting it on higher, infrequent counts. 

Below is the result of the algorithm describe above. On my machine it takes about a second to render. 
Although this isn't terrible, it's not great for an interactive experience.

To speed things up, I rewrote the algorithm as a fragment shader. A fragment shader is essentially just a 
function that is called for every pixel of every shape drawn on the screen and returns the color 
that pixel should be...exactly what I needed. 
The function runs on the GPU and is called many times in parallel, so it's much faster than the CPU 
implementation. The high level steps I took to accomplish this are as follows: 

1. Initialize WebGL
    - Compile and Link vertex and fragment shader 
    - Call other WebGL initialization functions
2. Setup WebGL variables that we can use to communicate between the host JavaScript application and the 
shader function. 
    - Canvas Resolution
    - Center Coordinate
    - Zoom
3. Draw shapes on the screen such that they cover the entire window. I did this by drawing 2 triangles with
each triangle covering half of the screen. This step will cause the fragment shader to run and set the color
of every pixel in the canvas. 
4. Upon user input, update the WebGL variables from step 2 so that the view is updated. 
    - On scroll wheel, update the Zoom variable. 
    - On click, update the Center Coordinate variable

Here's the final result. You can click around to center the view on your cursor, and zoom in/out using 
the scroll wheel (pinch on mobile).
